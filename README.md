# FlagsProject
I made one flag and now I want to make more. I'll update as I go. 

Update on 3/4/2020
- added more flags (I believe) 
- added buttons and descriptions for each of the flags 

Current bugs include a weird one where it will resize one of the text boxes to the entire screen with no way to exit unless you exit the program. You aslso have to hover over the spaces for the buttons for the buttons to appear, unless it's the first button. Not quite sure how to fix this yet.
